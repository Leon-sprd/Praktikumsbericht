### the first day on my internship
 
On this forst day i drove with my big cousin to [Spreadshirt](https://www.spreadshirt.de) my new workings place for the next two weeks. My internship is in [Leipzig](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leipzig/@51.341699,12.2535538,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a6f818200f2c73:0x93df80d2b9b4f552!8m2!3d51.3396955!4d12.3730747).
 
The day starts 9.45 am with a so called *stand up*. A stand up is a meeting format where ever everybody say what he/she did yesterday, what the have achieved or not achieved and what they'll do today.

After that Nils/Lars headed me around in the office bulding and showed me

* the meeting rooms
* the printers for printing directely on shirts
* the company kitchens
* the office rooms
* ... 


After the tour, Jonas showed me how to do a *hotfix* for a critical bug. 

> A hotfix is ​​a software update that the manufacturer of a software application (program) provides to correct an error as quickly as possible. Hotfix is ​​derived from the two English words hot and to fix. 
> <cite>[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix)</cite>

He also taught me basics about branching and the [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. See how the branching works [here](https://nvie.com/img/git-model@2x.png).

At lunch time about twelve a.m. we walk to a chineese restaurant called [*Chinabrenner*](https://goo.gl/maps/vW7HDmo4o3poZa4s5) with an applicant for a job at Spreadshirt. About one hour later I played a "css game" to learn how about css selectors. At the end Tony showed me a program calles MacDown, which is a visiual editor for [markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an text expression language. 
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. <cite> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) <cite>
