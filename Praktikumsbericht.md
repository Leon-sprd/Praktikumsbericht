## 16.09.2019 
### the first day on my internship
 
On this first day I drove with my big cousin to [Spreadshirt](https://www.spreadshirt.de) my new workingplace for the next two weeks. My internship is in [Leipzig](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leipzig/@51.341699,12.2535538,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a6f818200f2c73:0x93df80d2b9b4f552!8m2!3d51.3396955!4d12.3730747).
 
The day starts 9.45 am with a so called *stand up*. A stand up is a meeting format where ever everybody say what he/she did yesterday, what the have achieved or not achieved and what they'll do today.

After that Lars headed me around in the office bulding and showed me

* the meeting rooms
* the printers for printing directely on shirts
* the company kitchens
* the office rooms
* ... 


After the tour, Jonas showed me how to do a *hotfix* for a critical bug. 

> A hotfix is ​​a software update that the manufacturer of a software application (program) provides to correct an error as quickly as possible. Hotfix is ​​derived from the two English words hot and to fix. 
> <cite>[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix)</cite>

He also taught me basics about branching and the [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. See how the branching works [here](https://nvie.com/img/git-model@2x.png).

At lunch time about twelve a.m. we walk to a chineese restaurant called [*Chinabrenner*](https://goo.gl/maps/vW7HDmo4o3poZa4s5) with an applicant for a job at Spreadshirt. About one hour later I played a "css game" to learn how about css selectors. At the end Tony showed me a program calles MacDown, which is a visiual editor for [markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), an text expression language. 
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. <cite> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) <cite>

## 17.09.2019
### day 2 Tuesday

* stand up
* first steps about a Computer language named Java 


Like yesterday we had this so called *stand up* at the same time. After that I continued playing the *css game*. Then Tony showed me the first stepps and skills about Java, like how to find out the maximum/minimum of a list numbers, how to add all together or something like this little computational tasks. 

Here is the function for finding a minimum number of a list of numbers

```
public static int min(int[] numbers) {
    int min = numbers[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        int currentNumber = numbers[i];
        if (currentNumber < min) {
            min = currentNumber;
        }
    }
    return min;
}
```
Test driven design
Tony showed me also what inharrity is.
>The faculty is a function that assigns a natural number of all natural numbers (whitout zero) less than and equal to that number. It is abbreviated by an exclamation mark ("!") Following the argument. 
>>For example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 <cite> [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakult%C3%A4t_(Mathematik)) <cite>

In the laster part of the day Jonas showed me how he is debuggin something from other peoples websites in [Shopify](https://www.shopify.de/) .


## 18.09.2019
### day 3 Wednesday

* lernined sth. about inharrity
* cooked curry with rice
* intense lerning about Java with videos or text


At first was the stand up. Then Tony showed and repeated with me inharrity and the other computational tasks. After lunch I taught myself some thinks about Java with Videos and text´s to have better basics. In the laster part Jonas showed me how he debugged some more problems. 

## 19.09.2019
### day 4 Thursday

* I was told how to move files from MacDown to GitHub

On day four Jonas showed me how to publish my MacDown text´s to GitHub. We created my own [GitHub](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/GitHub) account.
he also told me what an ssh key is and we created my own key. After that he explaned me the two biggest and most often used Project Management systems, [Scrum](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum) and Waterfall.
>Simply put, waterfall project management is a sequential, linear process of project management. It consists of several discrete phases. No phase begins until the prior phase is complete, and each phase’s completion is terminal—waterfall management does not allow you to return to a previous phase. The only way to revisit a phase is to start over at phase one. [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/waterfall-project-management-methodology)

Then he showed me how he works on Gira tickets. A bit later Nils told me something about instances, classes and inharrity. Then follows an office meeting with everyone in the company. The meeting is called *GA*, where information from the company is shared with each other. At the end I bulit out my Java Informaion to get a better nowledge.

In this new week we start like every single day with this Stand up were everybody told what they have done. In the first two hours Tony told me something about the *Conversion of number systems* and Jonas told me something other.. . After lunch, wich was every day about from 12 to 12.30-1 , Jonas told me how Pointers works and what is their task.
>In computer science, a pointer is a programming language object that stores the memory address of another value located in computer memory. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming))

When we finished I red something about Test Automation for Web Applications and [selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/01_introducing_selenium.jsp) . And to the end I visited how Jonas created a feature and merge request and told me something about the *four-eyes principle* wich means that when he was ready he sent it to another developer that he also can look over it again. And he improved some parts of the code, added tests.

## My Workspace
my workspace is a larger room where 11 large tables with Monitors on it are sorted in the room with chairs. In a corner is still a sofa and there is a direct door to an intermediate platform in the outside. Everybody had a Laptop with it´s favourite System like Windows, Linux or MAC OS. I had the choice of where I wanted to sit down, on a table, on the sofa or outside the room on various chairs or sofas, which are in an open space with a kitchen on a wall, called *Spreadcafé*. Spreadshirt provided me with a Macbook so that I could work well. I work in the field Order Management, Fulfillment and controlling at Spreadshirt.

>Order fulfillment is in the most general sense the complete process from point of sales inquiry to delivery of a product to the customer. Sometimes order fulfillment is used to describe the more narrow act of distribution or the logistics function, however, in the broader sense it refers to the way firms respond to customer orders. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_fulfillment)

 There are many different areas in this company where groups of people work in rooms like the room where I was.
